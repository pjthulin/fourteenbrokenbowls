<strong>Fourteen Broken Bowls</strong> is the recordings of the sounds created by porcelain bowls being first hit with a mallet and then dropped to the floor to be broken. This project is a collaboration between south african ceramist artist John Bauer and multimedia creator RetrosoniX.

The fourteen bowls were discarded by John as they were all flawed in some way or did not meet johns high quality standard. John keeps a pile of shards in his backyard from all the discarded ceramics. This project will attempt to provide another avenue for these works to still find their own artistic relevance. 

The recordings are provided to all musicians in the world, professionals and amateurs, as a sample library to be used in music, sound and multimedia projects. The samples are free to use under creative commons license as long as attribution is given.
If you use our samples, please let us know so we can link to your work from our blog. Please use the contact form if you would like us to send you the entire library sample pack in 24bit 96khz quality.
 
To listen to the samples you can click the hammer icons underneath each bowl. ASlso look on this page for examples from other artist on how to use the samples. Arjuna Kohlstock from Juki&Seal have made an amazing jingle called baked apples.

The following people helped in the creation of this project and we owe them our uttermost gratitude: Karen Kotze for the amazing photos, Adrian Kraft for his wonderful mallet work and Bettina Thulin for her sweeping broom contributions.
