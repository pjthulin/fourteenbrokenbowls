===================

The John Bauer "Fourteen Broken Bowls" project website

The purpose of this project is to create a static website using Jekyll.

I use isotope for the masonry layout.

Issues:

  1) I had to hack jplayer to enable multiple players on the same page with different buttons. I chose jplayer to enable broad playback support. Other suggestion are welcome. 
  
  2) Load is slow. Have to find way of optimizing load time.
  
  3) The design needs something. Not sure what....
